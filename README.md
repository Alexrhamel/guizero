# Mission statement
The aim of guizero is to make the process of creating simple GUIs quick, accessible and understandable for children.

# Aims
* Works with standard Python GUI library (and no need to install other libraries)
* Abstracts away details children find hard (such as Tkinter StringVar() objects)
* Accessible widget naming system to help children to build up a mental model
* Flexible enough to be used for projects up to A-Level standard, yet accessible to primary school children
* Comprehensive and accessible documentation with examples - Coming Soon!
* Helpful error messages

# Documentation

In progress!
